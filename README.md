ESP-32 program for rotator control


This program is part of my Barchelor Thesis. The main goal was to develop a user-friendly web interface for controlling the rotator. 
The program is also able to connect the ESP with Gpredict.

The ESP is running a webserver with all the functions implemented so the user can only see the simple controls on the website.
